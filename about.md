Founder, programmer, autodidact. I've spent years designing, building, and shipping software. Ranging from VoIP, GPS-based tracking, smart phone apps, and photo editing across Linux, OS X, Windows, Android, and iOS. I adapt effortlessly to working in new industries and technologies.

I founded StarByte Software(2004) and Pixanode(2015) to build great software. As a result, programming has become a necessary part of my life. It's just something I have to do like eat or sleep. I dream code. Unfortunately, running the companies required wearing many other hats to keep things running smoothly. So at the end of 2016, I left both companies to seek opportunities focused completely on programming.

Software to me is a tool that should help you get your job done. It should be there when you need it and out of the way when you don't. And most of it all, it should be fast.

I enjoy contributing to open source projects and writing code in C++ and Rust. Check out my [Github Page](https://github.com/jbendig) to see some of my open source work.

I love working on challenging projects. Reach out if you or your team are in need of help.
